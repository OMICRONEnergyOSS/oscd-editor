This repository hold the XML editing engine inspired by the [OpenSCD core](https://github.com/openscd/open-scd-core) and is following the newest agreed [OpenSCD Core API](https://github.com/OpenEnergyTools/open-scd-core/blob/main/API.md)


## Usage

You can either load and use the `handleEdit` function through npm or other content delivery networks. This function does manipulate a XMLDocument as per user intent through the edit as its input:

```ts
const removeNode: Remove = {node: toBeRemovedNode}
handleEdit(removeNode)
```


You can also use the exported `Editor` class that inherits form `LitElement` that listens on the edit as specified in [OpenSCD Core API](https://github.com/OpenEnergyTools/open-scd-core/blob/main/API.md).
